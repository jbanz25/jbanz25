### I am Jacob Bananal
- I am a Computer Engineering Undergraduate Student.
- For this class (COMPE-561), I plan to learn how to write in HTML, CSS, and etc in Github. 
- I also plan to learn not just the basics of Github but try to use it in a more advanced way. 
- In this course, I also want to be able to build a website directly from github. 
- As of right now, I am currently building a website with my group, learning how to use Github, and being able to build a website froms scratch myself. 
- My favorite hobbies are surfing, skateboarding, playing PS4, lifting heavy weights, and going out to the club :')
